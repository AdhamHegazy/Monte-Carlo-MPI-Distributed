# Monte-Carlo-MPI-Distributed
Distributed memory architecture to solve advanced computational algorithms using MPI.

The computational problem in question is estimating the value of PI.

It was solved in two different ways using a distributed memory architecture - in order to compare both.
The first way is using Broadcast and Reduce, the second way is using Send and Reduce.

It was also solved using a non-distrubuted approach, as a benchmark for performance.

There are therefore three C files, and three corresponding executable files.
